# SkiHub

## Mission Statement

The purpose of this website is to create a one-stop site to view information about the trail conditions at various Ikon ski resorts in Colorado. As of the start of this project, the resorts to include are Copper Mountain, Winter Park, and A-Basin.

## Tech Stack

This site is run on a LAMP webserver (a raspberry pi hanging off the end of our home router -> only for use at home).

ReactJS is the main front end library (the main point of this project is to get more comfortable with React as I've never used it before).
Python is used for the webscraping script that will pull trail data from the resorts.
MariaDB/MySQL is used to store the scraped information to be used by the site.
PHP will be used for the backend (SQL interfacing/data pulling).
